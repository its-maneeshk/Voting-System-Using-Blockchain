# Blockchain Voting System

This is a simple **Blockchain Voting System** built using **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, and **React**. The project is designed to allow users to vote for candidates on the blockchain, leveraging Ethereum's smart contract functionality for transparency and immutability.

### Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Built using **React** and **Vite** for a fast and responsive UI.
- **Backend**: A **Solidity** smart contract deployed using **Hardhat**, allowing users to vote for candidates.

**Note**: The Hardhat backend is still under development and is **not yet fully integrated** with the frontend. Therefore, the frontend won't fully interact with the smart contract just yet.

## Frontend Development

### Current Status
The frontend is built using React and Vite, and it provides a user interface for voting. However, the frontend is not yet fully integrated with the deployed smart contract, as the backend is still under development.

### Features
- Display a list of candidates
- Show the number of votes for each candidate
- Vote for a candidate (currently, the function is not connected to the blockchain

```
